# ThermoBeat-AI-HeartDetection


The goal of this model is to accurately predict heart attacks based on ECG data from pacemakers. Apps, such as MyCareLink by Medtronic, enable pacemaker patients to view sensory data from their pacemakers in real time. These apps do not, however, feature functionality for patients to understand this health data.

For instance, how might an average patient perceive this image?


To most, this image has no functional importance. The use of AI, however, enables the potential for recognizing trends in ECG data from pacemakers to predict cardiac events, such as heart attacks, before they occur. This method is possible due to small changes in the Q-R-S movements in an ECG, which may indicate the development of plaque or atherosclerosis, and reveal negative trends in cardiac health. 

This program 














In the future, I hope to incoroporate a combination of all sensory data from pacemakers (including accelerometers) to produce an improved pictrue of patient health.
